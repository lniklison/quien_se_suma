Hi,

 This is a pet project that I made in order to learn the Nodejs stack. 
 Its an E-comerce site where you can register and buy supplies for your barbecue.
 The project is hosted in Heroku, you can visit it going to peaceful-cliffs-79034.herokuapp.com in your browser.
 Hope that you could use this as a help in your own project.

Cheers!
Lucas.
